Moodle Block - enrolmenttimer
Developed by - Aaron Leggett - LearningWorks Ltd

This block provides the functionality to display the time a user has left in their enrolment period. There are many settings to choose from to customise the way this is displayed to the user. A notification can be sent on a set period before the enrolment expires advising the user that their enrolment is coming to an end. Another email notification can be sent once the user has received a set score in the course_total score.

The plugin has been developed with limited styling to enable the best possible base for theme overrides to align the design with your existing moodle theme.


VERSION UPDATES
===============

Version 2014061101,
- Function Names have been updated to align with the Moodle frankenstyle naming convention

Version 2014061205,
- Fixed up the functionality so the actual text value of each incremental
value is only set in one place. Code is more streamlined in this file
also.
- As per the request of 'German Valero', I have added the remaining
strings to the langfile for easy AMOS language conversion
